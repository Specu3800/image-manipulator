# Image Manipulator
Application for simple image editing. Image Processing (2018) </br>
* Task 1 - Application for image processing and analysis, elementary operations, geometric operations and noise removal.  
* Task 2 - Filtration in spatial domain (histogram modifications, linear and non-linear operations, convolution).
* Task 3 - Morphological operations, segmentation.
* Task 4 - Filtration in frequency domain.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
In order to properly build application one might need following dependences:
```
$ sudo apt install cimg-dev cimg-doc cimg-examples cmake gcc clang gdb build-essential libx11-dev libxext-dev
```

### Cloning
```
$ git clone https://github.com/msuliborski/image-manipulator
```

### Building
```
$ cd image-manipulator
$ cmake CMakeLists.txt 
$ make
```

### Usage
Using parameter `--help` one obtains list of avaliable commands. 
```
$ out/./image-manipulator --help
```
Here are examples of using program features:
```
$ ./image-manipulator --brightness 40 ../img/color/lena.bmp output.bmp
$ ./image-manipulator --median 3 ../img/noise-color/lena-impulse3.bmp output.bmp
$ ./image-manipulator --slaplace 2 ../img/color/lena.bmp output.bmp
```
There are also prepared scripts letting you quickly perform analysis of image manipulation.
```
$ ./denoiseAndAnalyse.sh --median 2 img/noise-color/lena-impulse3.bmp img/color/lena.bmp 
$ ./makeCharacteristicsAnalysis.sh img/color/lena.bmp 
```

## Built with
* [CImg](http://cimg.eu/) - small and open-source C++ toolkit for image processing
